# WEB_SCRAPING-CARS_WEBISTE
It is a web scraping project

##I did this course by learning from web scraping with python from greatlearning 

In this project first i did a normal web scraping of a website known as cars , i have scraped the data like car model, price, reviews , number of reviews, mileage, dealer name, then i did data cleaning after the result(in number of reviews count), but in this i scraped only 1 page.

Then after i came to know about paging then used it to scrape 10 pages of the cars website , then whole process will be same but in requests part there will be minute change in code like fist we will have the website as static string , but now i have divided the 1 static sting into 3 parts first part is static beacause it is same for all pages in this website  , second part is dynamic(this is part where the page number will be changed from 1 to 10) beacause only the page numbers are different in this website, third part will be static beacause it is same for all pages in this website only this the change for the previous code and rest are same as above.
