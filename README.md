# WEB_SCRAPING-CARS_WEBISTE
It is a web scraping project

It is a data science project that is used to collect data from a source like website and then extract specific information in an automated manner. It's often used for tasks like web scraping, where data needs to be gathered from different websites or online sources.

Web scraping, also called Web harvesting or Web data extraction, is the automated process of extracting pertinent data from websites. There are many reasons why one might want to do this. It might be for the purposes of collecting business listings for a telephone directory, gathering real estate information for a service that provides foreclosure listings across the country, tracking trends on social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook (e.g., examining how people are talking about topics like Valentine's Day), and many other things.

I did this course by learning from web scraping with python from greatlearning 

In this project first i did a normal web scraping of a website known as cars , i have scraped the data like car model, price, reviews , number of reviews, mileage, dealer name, then i did data cleaning after the result(in number of reviews count), but in this i scraped only 1 page.

Then after i came to know about paging then used it to scrape 10 pages of the cars website , then whole process will be same but in requests part there will be minute change in code like fist we will have the website as static string , but now i have divided the 1 static sting into 3 parts first part is static beacause it is same for all pages in this website  , second part is dynamic(this is part where the page number will be changed from 1 to 10) beacause only the page numbers are different in this website, third part will be static beacause it is same for all pages in this website only this the change for the previous code and rest are same as above.
